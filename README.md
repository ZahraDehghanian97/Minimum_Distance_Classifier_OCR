# Minimum_Distance_Classifier_OCR
In this Repository. I implement a Minimum Distance classifier to detect Numbers in different picture. it was implemented in different section; The description that each part is implemented for, will follow .  

Topic : An Attempt of Optical Character Recognition by Minimum Distance Classifier  
Keywords: Classification Problem, Minimum Distance Classifier, Optical Character Recognition  

A Minimum Distance Classifier attempts to classify an unlabelled sample to a class which minimise the distance between the sample and the class in multi-feature space. As minimising distance is a measure for maximising similarity, MDC actually assigns data to its most similar category.  
While MDC might look too basic, it works pretty well in some problems. One of them could be Optical Character Recognition (OCR), where the goal is to distinguish handwritten or printed text characters inside digital images of documents. You are working with a customised dataset here, which is available at dataset folder . The dataset is divided into three groups, which can be seen in Figure  
![picture_dataset](https://github.com/zahraDehghanian97/Minimum_Distance_Classifier_OCR/Capture.PNG)
  
 First, consider group (a).  
a. Using the train images, find and display the prototype of each of the available classes.  
b. Use test samples to evaluate your MDC classifier. Report the error.  
c. Repeat part a. and b. with group (b).  
d. Repeat part a. and b. with group (c).
